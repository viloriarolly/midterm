                <h5>Cagayanos</h5>
                <p>Cagayan is part of one of the largest valleys in the Philippines formed by the majestic Sierra Madre and Cordillera mountain ranges. 
                    It is traversed by the mighty 330-km long Cagayan River and its various tributaries.

                    Cagayan is a very ancient civilization. It has its distinct, rich and diverse culture. 
                    Commerce and trade was practiced by its inhabitants and has flourished with the Japanese, C
                    hinese and other neighbor Asian countries even before the Spanish colonizers reached its shores.
                     Archeological findings dating back to the Paleolithic Age indicate that the ancestors of modern humans
                      had settled in Cagayan as early as 500,000 years ago. Archeologists also found evidences that agriculture has developed
                       much earlier in Cagayan than in any other place in Asia. Its ancientness is evidenced by the presence of centuries-old 
                       churches and other religious relics, archeological sites of nomadic tribes, and richness of its local language and culture.</p>  
                       <h6>Languages</h6>
                       <p>English and Filipino are widely used and spoken in Cagayan. Predominant local languages are Ilocano, Ybanag, Ytawes and Malaueg. Pangasinense, Maranao and other dialects are also used in some areas where migrants abound.

                        Majority of the Cagayanos can speak at least two of the local languages and have good command, or at least a working knowledge, of the English language.</p>
